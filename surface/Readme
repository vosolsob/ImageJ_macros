#  EXTRACT SURFACE & INTERIOR MACRO  #
######################################

This ImageJ macro processes an active XYZC hyperstack from a confocal microscope and extracts the surface and internal signal for better visualization and representation of substructures.

The algorithm traverses the image column by column and row by row in a square grid with a size that can be determined as a fraction of the total image size. For each rectangle, the signal intensity along the axis (Z-axis profile) is computed and the resulting profile is numerically derived to determine the location of the inflection point of increasing intensity, which corresponds to the surface of the structure.

INSTALLATION & USE
##################

1) Download the surface_.ijm file to any folder and install it from the ImageJ environment via the command "Plugins > Macros > Install..."
A new tool will appear in the menu, the red circle.

2) Load XYZC hyperstack, e. g. nd2 file from confocal microscope (max. number of channels is 5)
3) Click the macro Active Tool (red circle)
4) Select options in dialog:
   - a base delimiter is used for extraction of the base part of the analyzed image name, e.g. from the image title "StackO1_ch405/ch488/ch515", the part "StackO1" will be extracted by using "_" character.
   - select a channel, whcich will be used for a surface detection. Only one channel will analysed, the others are only used for extractio. Use channel, where a visualisation of the surface is the best.
   - specify, how many slices will be extracted as a surface layer before and after the detected surface.
   - specify the ratio of testing window to the total image, deafult ratio is 1 %.
   - specify the tolerance for surface detection; the value is in units of intensity, if the noise-signal difference is to low, set lower value, e. g. 5
   - specify, if the default surface will be in the first image or in the last. If the very top of the object is missing, select "first".
   - specify, if masks created during the computation may be showed
   - specify, if also the interior space may be detected and showed (the surface detection is a default behaviour)
   - specify, if automatic level adjustment may be aplied to output images
   
5) If you want to change dafault setting, edit the macro file in section after comment //CHANGE DEFAULT VALUES HERE: (~ line 29)

20.1.2023 - Fixed a bug causing error when two- and one-channel images were analysed (4-D mask is now created with the same number of dimmensions as original stack
